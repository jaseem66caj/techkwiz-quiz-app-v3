# Components That Didn't Work Properly

## 1. Percy Integration
- **What was installed:**
  - `@percy/cli` (dev dependency)
  - `@percy/next` (dev dependency)
  - `.percy.yaml` configuration file
  - Multiple Percy-related npm scripts in package.json:
    - `percy`: "percy snapshot src/__tests__/visual/baselines/*.png"
    - `percy:dev`: "percy dev"
    - `percy:build`: "next build && percy snapshot out/"

- **Issues encountered:**
  - "Module not found" errors when trying to run Percy scripts
  - Unable to generate baseline images
  - Scripts failed to execute properly

## 2. Puppeteer Integration
- **What was installed/attempted:**
  - Puppeteer dependency (not explicitly in package.json, but attempted to use)
  - Multiple Puppeteer test scripts:
    - `createBaselines.js` - Main baseline creation script
    - `simple-puppeteer-test.js` - Simple test script
    - `basic-puppeteer-test.js` - Basic functionality test
    - `verify-puppeteer.js` - Verification script
    - `createBaselinesWithLogging.js` - Enhanced logging version
    - `offline-test.js` - Offline testing approach

- **Issues encountered:**
  - "Module not found" errors when requiring puppeteer
  - Scripts failed to launch browser
  - Unable to capture screenshots
  - Dependencies not properly installed

## 3. Related Configuration Files
- **Percy configuration:**
  - `.percy.yaml` - Configuration file with viewport settings
- **Test scripts directory:**
  - Multiple JavaScript files in `src/__tests__/visual/` that were designed to work with Puppeteer/Percy

## Root Cause Analysis
The main issues were:
1. Missing or improperly installed dependencies (puppeteer not in package.json)
2. Module resolution problems with Puppeteer and Percy packages
3. Environment-specific issues preventing proper execution

## Solution Implemented
We replaced the problematic Puppeteer/Percy approach with:
- **Playwright** - More reliable modern alternative
- Proper dependency installation in package.json
- New test scripts designed for Playwright
- Better error handling and reporting
