## Diagnostic Steps Taken

### 1. Repository Configuration Check
- Attempted to verify git remote configuration
- Checked for existing remote URL
- Verified repository name and owner

### 2. Authentication Verification
- Confirmed Personal Access Token is valid for 90 days
- Token has full repository access permissions

### 3. Local Repository Status
- Git repository is initialized locally
- Files are committed and ready for push
- Local repository is functional

### 4. Network and API Tests
- Attempted to create repository via GitHub API
- Tested push operations
- Verified credentials with GitHub

## Possible Causes

### 1. Repository Not Created
The repository may not have been successfully created during the initial deployment process, despite the scripts running.

### 2. Repository Name Issue
There might be a discrepancy in the repository name:
- Specified: TechKwiz-v8
- Actual: Could be different due to naming conflicts

### 3. Authentication Issues
Although the token is valid, there might be:
- Insufficient permissions
- Token not properly applied during push operations
- Network restrictions preventing access

### 4. GitHub Service Issues
Temporary GitHub service issues might be preventing:
- Repository creation
- Repository access
- API responses

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Manual Repository Creation
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Create a new repository with:
   - Name: TechKwiz-v8
   - Visibility: Private
   - Leave all checkboxes unchecked
4. After creation, connect your local repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/jaseem66caj/TechKwiz-v8.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Solution 2: Verify Repository Exists
1. Check your GitHub profile: https://github.com/jaseem66caj
2. Look for TechKwiz-v8 repository in the list
3. If it exists with a different name, update the remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jaseem66caj/ACTUAL_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```

### Solution 3: Recreate Repository with Different Name
If there's a naming conflict:
1. Create repository with name like TechKwiz-v8-2
2. Update remote URL accordingly
3. Push all files

### Solution 4: Verify Personal Access Token
1. Confirm token has repo permissions
2. Check if token has been revoked
3. Generate new token if needed

## Next Steps

1. Manually create the repository on GitHub
2. Connect local repository to the new remote
3. Push all files to GitHub
4. Verify repository is accessible
