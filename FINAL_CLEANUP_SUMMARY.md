   - Removed `@percy/cli` from devDependencies
   - Removed `@percy/next` from devDependencies

2. **Percy Configuration**:
   - Deleted `.percy.yaml` configuration file

3. **Percy Scripts**:
   - Removed `percy`, `percy:dev`, and `percy:build` scripts from package.json

4. **Puppeteer Test Files**:
   - Deleted `basic-puppeteer-test.js`
   - Deleted `createBaselines.js`
   - Deleted `createBaselinesWithLogging.js`
   - Deleted `offline-test.js`
   - Deleted `simple-puppeteer-test.js`

   - Deleted `verify-puppeteer.js`

5. **Utility Files**:
   - Deleted `puppeteer-check.js`

6. **Percy Spec Files**:
   - Deleted `specs/homepage.spec.js`

## Remaining Playwright Implementation

All Playwright components remain intact and functional:

1. **Dependencies**:
   - `@playwright/test` (dev dependency)

2. **Configuration**:
   - `playwright.config.ts`

3. **Test Scripts**:
   - `playwright-test.js`
   - `techkwiz-homepage.spec.js`
   - `run-visual-tests.sh`
   - `simple-node-test.js` (kept as reference)

4. **Documentation**:
   - `README.md`

## Verification

✅ **package.json** has been updated to remove unused dependencies and scripts
✅ **Playwright implementation** remains fully functional
✅ **No broken references** or dependencies in the remaining codebase
✅ **Cleaner project structure** with only necessary components

## Impact

- **Reduced project size** by removing unused dependencies
- **Simplified maintenance** by eliminating multiple testing approaches
- **Improved clarity** by focusing on a single, working solution
- **No negative impact** on existing functionality

The visual regression testing system is now streamlined and uses only the reliable Playwright implementation.
