# Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive performance optimization plan for the TechKwiz Quiz App to improve component rendering speed, reduce bundle size, enhance loading times, and provide a better user experience.

## Current State Analysis

### Bundle Size Analysis
- Main dependencies: `framer-motion`, `@sentry/nextjs`, `next`, `react`, `react-dom`
- No current bundle analysis setup
- Potential for code splitting and lazy loading

### Rendering Performance
- Components use framer-motion for animations
- Some components may benefit from React.memo and useCallback optimizations
- No current virtualization implementation

### Build Process
- Standard Next.js build process
- Basic webpack optimization in next.config.js
- No advanced build optimizations

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

#### Route-based Code Splitting
- Leverage Next.js automatic code splitting by route
- Ensure dynamic imports for heavy components

#### Component-based Code Splitting
- Identify and implement lazy loading for non-critical components:
  - FortuneCookie component
  - SocialProofBanner component
  - NewsSection component
  - Features component

#### Dynamic Imports Implementation
```javascript
// Example of dynamic import for a heavy component
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const FortuneCookie = dynamic(() => import('@/components/ui/FortuneCookie'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <div>Loading...</div>
})
```

### 2. Bundle Size Optimization

#### Dependency Optimization
- Analyze and remove unused dependencies
- Use tree-shaking to eliminate unused code
- Consider lighter alternatives for heavy dependencies where possible

#### Webpack Bundle Analyzer Setup
- Install webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Add analysis script to package.json
- Regular analysis to identify bundle size issues

#### Import Optimization
- Use specific imports instead of importing entire libraries
- Implement code splitting for large utility libraries

### 3. Rendering Performance Improvements

#### React.memo Implementation
- Apply React.memo to components that render frequently
- Components to optimize:
  - CategoryCard
  - QuizOption
  - CoinDisplay
  - StreakDisplay

#### useCallback and useMemo Usage
- Use useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Apply useMemo for expensive calculations

#### Virtualization
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Use windowing techniques for better performance in category listings

### 4. Image Optimization

#### Next.js Image Component
- Replace all img tags with Next.js Image component
- Implement proper sizing and responsive images
- Use modern image formats (webp, avif)

#### Image Loading Strategies
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Use appropriate image sizes for different viewports
- Optimize image compression

### 5. Caching Strategies

#### Browser Caching
- Implement proper cache headers
- Use static asset versioning
- Optimize cache policies for different resource types

#### Application Caching
- Implement localStorage caching for quiz data
- Use React context for global state to reduce prop drilling
- Implement service worker for offline caching (PWA)

### 6. Animation Performance

#### Animation Optimization
- Reduce animation complexity on lower-end devices
- Use CSS animations where possible instead of JavaScript
- Implement animation throttling

#### Framer Motion Optimization
- Simplify complex framer-motion animations
- Reduce simultaneous animations
- Optimize animation durations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Analysis (Week 1)
1. Install webpack-bundle-analyzer
2. Add bundle analysis script to package.json
3. Run initial bundle analysis
4. Identify largest bundles and optimization opportunities
5. Set up performance monitoring

### Phase 2: Code Splitting (Week 2)
1. Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
2. Optimize route-based code splitting
3. Add lazy loading for non-critical components
4. Test performance improvements

### Phase 3: Rendering Optimizations (Week 3)
1. Apply React.memo to frequently rendered components
2. Implement useCallback and useMemo where appropriate
3. Optimize component re-renders
4. Test rendering performance

### Phase 4: Image and Asset Optimization (Week 4)
1. Replace img tags with Next.js Image component
2. Implement proper image sizing and formats
3. Optimize asset loading strategies
4. Test loading performance

### Phase 5: Caching and Advanced Optimizations (Week 5)
1. Implement browser caching strategies
2. Add application-level caching
3. Optimize animations and transitions
4. Final performance testing

## Testing and Verification

### Performance Metrics
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)

### Testing Tools
- Lighthouse performance audits
- WebPageTest.org
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Playwright performance testing

### Monitoring
- Sentry performance monitoring
- Custom performance metrics
- Regular performance audits

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Improvements
- 20-30% reduction in bundle size
- 15-25% improvement in loading times
- 25-40% reduction in rendering time
- Better user experience on lower-end devices

### User Experience Benefits
- Faster initial page load
- Smoother animations and transitions
- Improved responsiveness
- Better performance on mobile devices

## Rollback Plan

### If Performance Degradation Occurs
1. Revert recent changes
2. Run performance tests to identify issues
3. Implement fixes or alternative approaches
4. Retest with monitoring

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Set up performance degradation alerts
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Implement error tracking for performance-related issues

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- Lighthouse performance score > 90
- FCP < 1.8 seconds
- LCP < 2.5 seconds
- FID < 100 milliseconds
- CLS < 0.1

### Qualitative Metrics
- Improved user feedback on loading times
- Reduced bounce rate on quiz pages
- Better performance on mobile devices
- Positive feedback on app responsiveness

## Next Steps
