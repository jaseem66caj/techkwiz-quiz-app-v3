# TechKwiz-v8 GitHub Deployment Instructions

## Prerequisites

1. Git installed on your system
2. GitHub account
3. This TechKwiz-v8 project

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Sign in to your GitHub account if prompted
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Repository name**: `TechKwiz-v8`
   - **Description**: "A modern interactive quiz game with visual regression testing"

   - **Important**: Leave all checkboxes **unchecked** (don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Note Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, you'll see a page with your repository URL. It will look like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TechKwiz-v8.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/jaseem/Documents/GitHub/Techkwiz-v8

# Add GitHub as a remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TechKwiz-v8.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v
```

### Step 4: Deploy to GitHub

```bash
# Push all files to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see all your files uploaded

## Alternative Deployment Method (Using GitHub CLI)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/jaseem/Documents/GitHub/Techkwiz-v8

# Create repository and push
gh repo create TechKwiz-v8 --public --source=. --push
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "Permission denied" errors:
1. Make sure you're using the correct GitHub credentials
2. Consider using a Personal Access Token instead of your password

### If you get "Updates were rejected":
1. Pull the latest changes first:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Resolve any conflicts
3. Push again

### If the push hangs or fails:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the repository URL is correct
3. Try using SSH instead of HTTPS (requires SSH key setup)

## Repository Contents

Your GitHub repository will include:

- **Core Application**: Next.js 15 frontend with TypeScript
- **Visual Testing**: Playwright implementation with multi-viewport testing
- **Documentation**: Design system and implementation details
- **Cleanup Work**: Removal of unused Percy/Puppeteer dependencies

## Post-Deployment Recommendations

1. **Set up GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
2. **Add a LICENSE file** if needed
3. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** for collaboration guidelines
4. **Add issue and pull request templates**

## Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check that Git is properly installed
2. Verify your GitHub credentials
3. Ensure you have proper internet connectivity
4. Confirm you're in the correct project directory

The TechKwiz-v8 project is now ready for deployment to GitHub with all its visual testing capabilities intact.
