- **Animations**: Animations should be smooth and maintain a consistent 60 frames per second.

## Scale/Scope

**Research Task**: Research and define the expected scale and scope for a client-side quiz application.

**Findings**:
- **Concurrent Users**: The application should be able to handle at least 100 concurrent users without any noticeable degradation in performance.
- **Quiz Content**: The application should be able to support up to 100 quiz categories with 50 questions each.

## Versioning

**Research Task**: Define a versioning scheme for the project.

**Findings**:
- The project will use Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
