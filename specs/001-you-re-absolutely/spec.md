# Feature Specification: Interactive Technology Quiz Platform (Client-Side Only)

**Feature Branch**: `001-you-re-absolutely`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "You're absolutely right. Let me revise my description to align with the actual Techkwiz-v8 project, which is a client-side only application without an admin dashboard: ## Techkwiz-v8: Interactive Technology Quiz Platform (Client-Side Only) We want to build an engaging, gamified technology quiz platform that helps users test and expand their knowledge across various tech domains through interactive quizzes and rewarding experiences - all running entirely in the browser with no backend required. ### Core Purpose The application serves as an educational entertainment platform where users can: - Test their knowledge in technology-related subjects through interactive quizzes - Earn rewards and track their progress through a coin-based system - Enjoy a lightweight, client-side experience without registration ### What We're Building #### 1. Interactive Quiz Experience We're creating a dynamic quiz interface where users can: - Choose from multiple technology categories (Movies, Social Media, Influencers, etc.) - Answer questions with immediate feedback and visual cues - Experience timed challenges with a 30-second countdown per question - See their progress through an intuitive quiz flow #### 2. Reward and Engagement System We're building a comprehensive reward mechanism that: - Awards coins for correct answers and quiz completion - Offers bonus rewards through optional ad viewing - Tracks streaks and multipliers for consistent engagement - Provides encouraging feedback and achievement notifications - Shows dynamic reward popups with animations and visual effects #### 3. User Progress Tracking We're creating features that encourage engagement through: - Guest mode for immediate access without registration - Profile creation and personalization - Streak tracking to encourage daily participation - Social sharing capabilities for achievements #### 4. Responsive Design We're implementing a mobile-first design approach that: - Works seamlessly on all device sizes - Uses a clean UI design with gradient backgrounds and glass-morphism elements - Implements smooth animations with Framer Motion - Follows accessibility best practices ### Why We're Building This 1. **Educational Value**: To provide an engaging way for people to learn about technology through interactive quizzes 2. **User Engagement**: To create a habit-forming experience that encourages daily interaction through rewards and streaks 3. **Lightweight Experience**: To offer a fast, client-side only application that works without any backend infrastructure 4. **Easy Deployment**: To create an application that can be easily deployed to static hosting platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages 5. **Content Flexibility**: To allow easy updating and expansion of quiz content through code changes The platform combines education with entertainment, using gamification elements to make learning about technology enjoyable and rewarding. Since it runs entirely in the browser using localStorage for data persistence, users can enjoy a fast, responsive experience without any server dependencies."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user can visit the website, choose a quiz category, answer questions with a 30-second time limit per question, and see their score and rewards at the end of the quiz.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the homepage, **When** they click on a quiz category, **Then** they are taken to the quiz page for that category.
2. **Given** a user is on a quiz page, **When** they select a correct answer, **Then** they receive positive feedback and their score increases.
3. **Given** a user is on a quiz page, **When** they select an incorrect answer, **Then** they receive negative feedback and their score does not change.
4. **Given** a user completes a quiz, **When** they see the results page, **Then** their final score and coin rewards are displayed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the 30-second timer for a question runs out?
- How does the system handle a user trying to take a quiz in offline mode?
- What happens if the user has insufficient coins for a feature that requires them?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to choose from multiple technology quiz categories.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide immediate feedback for each question answered.
- **FR-003**: System MUST have a 30-second timer for each question.
- **FR-004**: System MUST award coins for correct answers and quiz completion.
- **FR-005**: System MUST track user streaks and multipliers.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to play in guest mode without registration.
- **FR-007**: System MUST have a responsive, mobile-first design.
- **FR-008**: System MUST use `localStorage` for data persistence.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Quiz**: Represents a collection of questions in a specific category. Attributes: category name, questions.
- **Question**: Represents a single quiz question. Attributes: question text, options, correct answer, time limit.
- **User**: Represents a player. Attributes: profile information, coins, streaks.
