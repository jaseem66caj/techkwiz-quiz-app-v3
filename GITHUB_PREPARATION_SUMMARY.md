## Next Steps

To create and populate your GitHub repository:

1. **Create the repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it "TechKwiz-v8"
   - Keep it public or private as desired
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Connect your local repository**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jaseem/Documents/GitHub/Techkwiz-v8
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Techkwiz-v8.git
   ```

3. **Commit and push files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: TechKwiz-v8 with Playwright visual testing implementation"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Verify on GitHub**:
   - Visit your repository page
   - Confirm all files have been uploaded

## Future Considerations

After the initial commit, you may want to:

1. **Generate and commit visual testing baselines**:
   - Run the visual tests to generate baseline images
   - Commit the baseline images to track visual consistency

2. **Set up CI/CD**:
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Set up automatic deployment to hosting platform

3. **Create additional documentation**:
   - Contribution guidelines
   - Code of conduct
   - Issue templates
   - Pull request templates

The repository is now fully prepared for GitHub with comprehensive documentation and all necessary files organized for easy understanding and maintenance.
