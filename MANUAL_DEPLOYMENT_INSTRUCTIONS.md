# Manual Deployment Instructions for TechKwiz-v8

## Issue: Repository Not Accessible

Since the automated deployment process encountered issues, please follow these manual steps to deploy your TechKwiz-v8 project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

1. Git installed on your system
2. GitHub account (jaseem66caj)
3. Valid Personal Access Token (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)
4. This TechKwiz-v8 project

## Manual Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script
```bash
cd /Users/jaseem/Documents/GitHub/Techkwiz-v8
./manual-github-setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Verify your environment
- Stage all project files
- Create an initial commit

### Step 2: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (jaseem66caj)
3. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: TechKwiz-v8
   - **Description**: A modern interactive quiz game with visual regression testing
   - **Visibility**: Private
   - **Important**: Leave all checkboxes **unchecked**
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/jaseem/Documents/GitHub/Techkwiz-v8
git remote add origin https://jaseem66caj: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@github.com/jaseem66caj/TechKwiz-v8.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use HTTPS without embedding the token:

```bash
cd /Users/jaseem/Documents/GitHub/Techkwiz-v8
git remote add origin https://github.com/jaseem66caj/TechKwiz-v8.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials, use:
- Username: jaseem66caj
- Password: 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

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. Go to https://github.com/jaseem66caj/TechKwiz-v8
2. Refresh the page
3. Confirm all files have been uploaded

## Repository Contents

Your GitHub repository will include:

### Core Application
- Next.js 15 frontend with TypeScript
- Quiz functionality (Movies, Social Media, Influencers)
- Reward system with coin tracking
- Responsive design for all device sizes

### Visual Testing System
- Playwright implementation for visual regression testing
- Multi-viewport testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "Permission denied" errors:
1. Make sure you're using the correct GitHub credentials
2. Verify your Personal Access Token is valid
3. Confirm the token has "repo" permissions

### If you get "Updates were rejected":
1. Pull the latest changes first:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Resolve any conflicts
3. Push again

### If the push hangs or fails:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the repository URL is correct
3. Try using SSH instead of HTTPS (requires SSH key setup)

## Post-Deployment Recommendations

1. **Set up GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
2. **Add a LICENSE file** if needed
3. **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** for collaboration guidelines
4. **Add issue and pull request templates**
