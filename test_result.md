# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The main issue was in the guest user creation logic that was causing infinite re-renders. ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: Session-based coin system is now fully functional. 1) ✅ Users start with 0 coins on fresh browser session - verified in navigation display '🪙 0'. 2) ✅ Homepage quiz is free to play - quiz question 'Which programming language is known as the language of the web?' displays with JavaScript/Python/Java/C++ options. 3) ✅ Guest user auto-creation working - 'Hi, Guest User!' shown in navigation. 4) ✅ Navigation fully functional - Home, Categories, Leaderboard, Profile links working. 5) ✅ Session-based coin storage implemented - coins stored in sessionStorage, reset when browser closes. 6) ✅ Quiz interface interactive - answer buttons available for user interaction. 7) ✅ Backend APIs working - categories and questions endpoints returning correct data. The session-based coin system meets all requirements: users start with 0 coins, earn through quiz wins (50 coins per correct answer) and rewarded ads (100 coins each), with coins stored in sessionStorage for session-only persistence."

Correct answer' message displays correctly with treasure chest showing 3 gold coins. Popup positioned over quiz area (not center screen) with transparent background overlay. Claim button functional with ad simulation. 2) ✅ WRONG ANSWER STATE: 'Oops!! Wrong answer' message displays correctly with locked treasure chest (0 gold coins). Same positioning and overlay behavior as correct state. 3) ✅ POPUP POSITIONING: Popup appears over quiz area rather than center screen, with compact design matching requirements. Transparent background overlay working correctly. 4) ✅ TREASURE CHEST ANIMATION: SVG treasure chest displays different states - with coins for correct answers, without coins for wrong answers. Sparkle animations working correctly. 5) ✅ FUNCTIONALITY: Claim button triggers ad watching simulation (5 seconds), Close button works correctly, scroll prevention active during popup (body overflow: hidden), scroll restored after close (body overflow: visible). 6) ✅ DESIGN COMPLIANCE: Compact popup design with gradient background, proper button styling, and responsive layout. All visual elements match the uploaded image requirements. The RewardPopup component is fully functional and meets all specified requirements for both correct and wrong answer states."

All categories have required fields (id, name, entry_fee, icon). 3) ✅ SEQUENTIAL QUESTIONS API: GET /api/quiz/sequential-questions/{category_id} working correctly - tested 15 questions across 3 categories, each returning exactly 5 questions with proper structure (id, question, options, correct_answer). 4) ✅ REWARDED POPUP CONFIGURATION: GET /api/quiz/rewarded-config accessible with current settings - coin_reward=100, is_active=true, show_on_insufficient_coins=true, trigger_after_questions=1. 5) ✅ ADMIN AUTHENTICATION: Login working perfectly with username='admin', password='TechKwiz2025!' returning valid JWT tokens. 6) ✅ MONGODB CONNECTIVITY: Database connectivity and data persistence verified working correctly through status API endpoints. 🚀 CONCLUSION: Backend infrastructure is 100% ready for timer-based questions implementation.

    message: "🎯 REWARD POPUP CONFIGURATION SYSTEM COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED WITH 100% SUCCESS RATE: ✅ CRITICAL FINDING: The reward popup configuration system is working PERFECTLY - there are NO issues with frontend changes not reflecting backend configuration changes. All tests passed with 100% success rate. 1) ✅ CURRENT CONFIGURATION CHECK: Both GET /api/quiz/rewarded-config (public) and GET /api/admin/rewarded-config/homepage (admin) return consistent values and are properly synchronized. 2) ✅ ADMIN CONFIGURATION UPDATES: Successfully tested updating coin_reward from 100 to 150 via PUT /api/admin/rewarded-config/homepage with admin authentication (username='admin', password='TechKwiz2025!'). All fields (coin_reward, is_active, show_during_quiz, show_on_insufficient_coins, trigger_after_questions) update correctly. 3) ✅ VERIFICATION AFTER UPDATE: Public API immediately reflects all backend changes - updated coin_reward (150) is instantly returned by GET /api/quiz/rewarded-config. Admin and public APIs remain perfectly synchronized. 4) ✅ MULTIPLE CONFIGURATION CHANGES: Successfully tested multiple sequential updates (coin_reward: 100→150→200→175, is_active: true→false→true, multiple field updates). All changes persist correctly and are immediately reflected in public API. 5) ✅ NO CACHING ISSUES: 5 rapid consecutive requests return identical values, confirming no caching problems preventing updates. 6) ✅ DATABASE PERSISTENCE: Configuration changes persist correctly over time (tested 6+ seconds) with unique values (123) maintaining consistency. 🚀 CONCLUSION: The reward popup configuration system has NO technical issues. Backend changes are properly saved to database, public API returns updated values immediately, changes persist across requests, and there are no caching issues. If frontend is not reflecting changes, the issue is likely in frontend code not properly fetching/using the updated configuration, not in the backend system."
