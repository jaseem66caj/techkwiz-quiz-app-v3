### **Issue 2: Coin Reward System Malfunction in Category Quizzes** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Problem Identified:**
- **Root Cause:** Missing `UPDATE_COINS` dispatch in category quiz `handleAnswer` function
- **Impact:** Users weren't receiving coins immediately when answering correctly in category quizzes
- **Secondary Issue:** `ClientHomePage` component still had hardcoded 25 coin value

**Fixes Applied:**

#### **Fix 1: Category Quiz Immediate Coin Rewards**
**File:** `src/app/quiz/[category]/page.tsx`
**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: No coin award in handleAnswer function
if (correct) {
  setScore(s => s + 1);
  // Missing coin award logic
}

// AFTER: Added immediate coin reward
if (correct) {
  setScore(s => s + 1);
  // Award coins immediately for correct answers
  const rewardResult = calculateCorrectAnswerReward();
  dispatch({ type: 'UPDATE_COINS', payload: rewardResult.coins });
  console.log(`‚úÖ Correct answer! Earned ${rewardResult.coins} coins`);
}
```

#### **Fix 2: ClientHomePage Hardcoded Values**
**File:** `src/components/ClientHomePage.tsx`
**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Hardcoded 25 coins
const coinsEarned = finalIsCorrect ? 25 : 0 // 25 coins per correct answer

// AFTER: Centralized calculation
const rewardResult = finalIsCorrect ? calculateCorrectAnswerReward() : { coins: 0 };
const coinsEarned = rewardResult.coins;
```

**Verification Results:**
- **Tests Passed:** 15/15 (100%)
- **Immediate Coin Awards:** ‚úÖ Working correctly
- **Centralized Configuration:** ‚úÖ All components use reward calculator
- **No Hardcoded Values:** ‚úÖ All hardcoded coin values removed from quiz system
