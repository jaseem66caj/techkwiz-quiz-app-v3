The previous AI engineer successfully launched  as a Next.js application, mirroring  with core quiz functionality and initial monetization. The current AI engineer inherited the project to build out an admin dashboard and address critical data synchronization and UI/UX issues. The work progressed iteratively, first by resolving environment variable discrepancies and rebuilding the frontend to fix data display and mobile responsiveness. Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing the admin dashboard's usability, populating the database with more questions, and integrating advanced features like ad placement with placeholders, comprehensive social sharing, and an interactive fortune cookie feature inspired by Qureka. Recent efforts have centered on fine-tuning the design, including rectifying ad background integration and meticulously optimizing component sizes for a compact, mobile-first, game-like experience. The final task in the trajectory involves reducing the size of answer option boxes.

<product_requirements>
The initial product goal was to replicate  as  using Next.js, focusing on a mobile-first approach, SEO, and monetization via AdSense and rewarded ads. This involved creating dynamic quizzes, a coin-based reward system, and browser-only local storage authentication.

Subsequent requirements during the current development cycle:
1.  **Admin Dashboard**: A secure  route with username/password authentication for quiz, content, and site configuration management.
2.  **Quiz Management**: CRUD operations for quiz categories and questions via the dashboard, stored in MongoDB.
3.  **Configuration Management**: Control rewarded ad popups, integrate Google Analytics/Facebook Pixel, and inject custom code.
4.  **Ad Slot Management**: Integrate unique AdSense/Google AdX codes for 10 precise ad placements, mimicking .
5.  **Data Features**: Implement backup/export for quiz questions.
6.  **User Access**: Admin profile settings for changing credentials and a forgot password flow with email reset.
7.  **Data Synchronization**: Ensure real-time reflection of admin changes on the frontend.
8.  **UI/UX**: Maintain user-friendly mobile experience, fix large elements, and achieve a game-like design, similar to Qureka.
9.  **Fortune Cookie Feature**: Replace floating share button with an interactive fortune cookie with interstitial ads and random messages.
10. **Refined UI/UX**: Fix ad background (remove white spaces), optimize category box size, ensure full category names are visible, implement static right-aligned Live badges, add random winner timers, ensure dummy leaderboard data, and generally reduce overall text/box sizes for a more compact design.
11. **Quiz Flow Logic**: Ensure quiz buttons always show PLAY and trigger rewarded ad popup if users lack coins.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router, Client/Server Components), React Context, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, MongoDB (Motor/PyMongo), Bcrypt, JWT authentication.
-   **Data Management**: MongoDB for quizzes/config; local storage (legacy).
-   **Email**: For password reset (implied  for ).
-   **Monetization**: Google AdSense/AdX integration with placeholder IDs, Rewarded Video Ads.
-   **SEO**: Next.js Metadata, Sitemap, Robots.txt, OpenGraph tags.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project uses a Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend, structured as follows:



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Updated  to  to fix frontend data fetching.
-   : Modified for global providers, AdSense scripts, and social media meta tags. Recent changes involved simplifying AdSense scripts to fix build errors and adding social share meta tags.
-   : Homepage, updated for direct quiz start; recent changes reduced homepage quiz text and button sizes.
-   : Categories page. Modified to fetch categories from backend, display them in Qureka-style compact cards, show full category names, and include random winner timers. AdBanner and FortuneCookie components are also integrated here.
-   : Contains dummy leaderboard data, checked to confirm its existence as requested.
-   : Core admin component for quiz management. Initially fixed to use  and later enhanced for better UI/UX (search, quick actions, display of more questions).
-   : (Renamed from ). Manages ad rendering. Crucially modified multiple times to ensure ads' placeholder backgrounds match the website's dark gradient and eventually to return  in development mode to completely remove visual placeholders.
-   : Heavily modified to achieve Qureka-style compact design, display full category names, position Live badge on the right, and show random timers.
-   : **(NEW FILE)** Implements the interactive fortune cookie feature, including 3D design, interstitial ads, random messages, and engaging animations. Later refined for Qureka-style 3D look and compact size.
-   : Modified to remove social sharing buttons from the header to achieve a cleaner, Qureka-like appearance. Also, size adjustments were applied.
-   : Updated to receive quiz data from the backend. Recent changes significantly reduced text sizes (questions, options) and button sizes for a more compact UI.
-   : Modified to integrate ads and social sharing functionality. Later updated to support overall size reduction.
-   : **(NEW FILE)** Provides comprehensive social sharing buttons for multiple platforms. Integrated into  and .
-   : **(NEW FILE)** Admin authentication context. Fixed to correctly use  for API calls.
-   : **(NEW FILE)** A script created to populate the MongoDB database with additional quiz questions to meet the 50+ question requirement.
-   : **(NEW FILE)** A temporary script created to reset the admin password directly in the database when login issues arose.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate actual Google AdSense, Google AdX, and Prebid (requires Publisher ID and further configuration, currently using placeholders).
-   Complete comprehensive SEO optimization beyond current meta tags.
-   Implement advanced features such as real-time leaderboards, tournaments, and social sharing functionalities beyond the current client-side scope (the current leaderboard uses dummy data).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on a comprehensive UI/UX optimization requested by the user. The primary goal was to make the entire website's design more compact, reducing the overall size of text and elements, especially on mobile devices.

The previous actions taken were:
-   **Reducing Quiz Interface Sizes**: Modified  to decrease text sizes for questions and answer options, and make buttons smaller (, ).
-   **Making Category Cards Smaller**: Adjusted padding and text/icon sizes in relevant components impacting  (, , ).
-   **Shrinking Header**: Reduced main title and subtitle sizes in the header.
-   **Homepage Quiz Adjustments**: Applied size reductions to homepage-specific elements and confirmed the existing  component updates would apply.
-   **Quiz Completion Screen**: Made the quiz completion screen more compact.

During these changes, the AI engineer encountered multiple syntax errors related to missing or duplicate HTML/JSX closing tags in  and . These were systematically identified and fixed.

The current, immediate task is to Just slightly decrease the size of the answer option boxes. Make it look good. This suggests that while overall size adjustments were made, the answer options still require fine-tuning for optimal aesthetics and compactness, particularly on mobile.

<optional_next_step>
Adjust the size of the answer option boxes in the quiz interface to be slightly smaller for an improved aesthetic.
