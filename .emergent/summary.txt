The AI engineer successfully transformed  into , evolving from a React clone to a Next.js application. Initial efforts focused on pixel-perfect UI replication, leading to a fully functional frontend with a homepage, categories, profile, and leaderboard pages. A significant phase involved implementing a comprehensive, original quiz system with diverse tech categories, difficulty levels, and a coin-based reward mechanism. The application adopted a mobile-first design aligning with the original's aesthetics and incorporated a browser-only authentication system using local storage. The most recent work focuses on optimizing the application for traffic and monetization, specifically by integrating SEO best practices (sitemaps, robots, metadata) and preparing for Google AdSense, AdX, and Prebid compliance and integration.

The primary objective was to clone  as , focusing on a pixel-perfect, responsive frontend initially in React. The scope expanded to a full Next.js rebuild for enhanced SEO and performance, cloning *all* pages (including  categories) and integrating AdSense. The application needed dynamic quiz pages with original content and a comprehensive reward system. A mobile-first design approach was explicitly adopted to match the original. Later, the user specified a browser-only authentication system with local storage for coins and user data, eliminating the need for a backend for these aspects. The ultimate goal is to drive organic traffic and maximize AdSense, AdX, and Prebid monetization, ensuring full Google policy compliance and search engine ranking.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with optimizing TechKwiz for maximum organic traffic and ad revenue, ensuring full compliance with Google policies. The work in progress involves implementing comprehensive SEO and AdSense compliance.

The application is currently a fully functional, mobile-first quiz platform operating entirely on the frontend with browser-only authentication. Key features implemented include:
-   **Browser-Only Authentication:** Users can log in with any email/password, receiving 500 starting coins. User profiles, coins, quiz history, and achievements are persistently stored in the browser's local storage, requiring no backend.
-   **Mobile-First Design:** The UI mimics the original Quizwinz with horizontal category cards, orange branding, live status indicators, and touch-optimized elements, ensuring responsiveness across devices.
-   **Comprehensive Quiz System:** Over 50 original tech questions spanning 8 categories (Programming, AI, Web Dev, Mobile, Data Science, Cybersecurity, Cloud, Blockchain) are available. Each category offers 3 difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) with scaling entry fees and coin rewards. The quiz flow includes timed questions, real-time scoring, streak bonuses, and a progress tracking system with achievements.
-   **Rewarded Ad Popup System:** A rewarded video ad popup is strategically integrated: after the first correct answer on the homepage, and after every 3 correct answers in category quizzes. This simulates an ad viewing experience, allowing users to double their coins.

The work being done *right now* is focused on establishing the foundational elements for SEO and monetization compliance. This includes:
-   Creation of  for SEO utilities.
-   Creation of  and  for search engine crawling.
-   Updates to  to include global SEO metadata and the Google AdSense script.
-   Creation of an enhanced  component for compliant ad display.
-   Creation of  to manage Google AdSense content policy adherence.
-   Creation of  and  for required legal pages.
The last explicit action in the trajectory was Now let me update the homepage metadata to be more SEO-focused (Chat Message 199), indicating the current task is to refine and expand SEO metadata implementation across the site.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Complete the SEO metadata updates for all pages and components, then proceed with the actual integration of Google AdSense, AdX, and Prebid.
