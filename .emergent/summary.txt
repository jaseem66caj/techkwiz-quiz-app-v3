The previous AI engineer successfully transformed  into , migrating from a React clone to a Next.js application with a mobile-first philosophy. Initial work focused on replicating UI, establishing a comprehensive quiz system with original content, and implementing a browser-only authentication using local storage. A significant phase involved integrating SEO features (sitemaps, robots, metadata) and preparing for Google AdSense. User feedback frequently redirected efforts towards critical responsive design issues, particularly text and element sizing on various mobile devices, leading to multiple iterations of UI adjustments, culminating in a full-width, larger element design akin to a provided reference. Additionally, a WordPress news integration was implemented for the categories page, and the quiz flow was refined to remove mandatory login, auto-start quizzes, and adjust rewarded ad frequency. The work demonstrated iterative problem-solving and adaptation to direct user feedback, with a strong focus on mobile user experience and foundational monetization/SEO setup.

The initial goal was to clone  as , first as a pixel-perfect React frontend, then as a Next.js application for SEO and performance. This included cloning all pages, implementing dynamic quizzes with original content, a coin-based reward system, and a mobile-first design. The scope expanded to include browser-only authentication using local storage for user data and coins, eliminating a backend for these aspects. A crucial objective was to drive organic traffic and maximize AdSense, AdX, and Prebid monetization, requiring Google policy compliance and SEO optimization. Subsequent explicit requests focused on: ensuring full responsive design compatibility across all mobile devices (e.g., text/box sizing on OnePlus 13S), adding a live news section from  WordPress site to the categories page, removing the mandatory login for quizzes (allowing direct play via coins), eliminating difficulty selection for quizzes, and adjusting the rewarded ad popup to appear after every 5 questions, only when coins are insufficient.

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate actual Google AdSense, Google AdX, and Prebid (requires Publisher ID and further configuration).
-   Complete comprehensive SEO optimization for all pages and components beyond the initial setup (e.g., dynamic pages' metadata refinement).
-   Expand the quiz question database with more content beyond the current 50+ questions.
-   Implement advanced features such as real-time leaderboards, tournaments, and social sharing functionalities beyond the current client-side scope.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was primarily focused on addressing critical mobile responsiveness issues and refining the core quiz user experience based on direct user feedback.

The application is a fully functional, mobile-first quiz platform with browser-only authentication.
Key features currently implemented include:
-   **Browser-Only Authentication:** Users are auto-logged in as Guest User with 500 coins; user profiles, coins, and quiz history are stored in local storage.
-   **Comprehensive Quiz System:** Over 50 original tech questions across 8 categories with varying entry fees and rewards. The quiz flow is now streamlined: no mandatory login, no difficulty selection, and quizzes auto-start directly after category selection (if coins are sufficient).
-   **Rewarded Ad Popup System:** Integrated to offer users 200 coins for watching a simulated ad. This popup strategically appears after every 5 correct answers during a quiz, and on the categories page when a user attempts to play a quiz category without sufficient coins. Crucially, the popup *does not* appear on the categories page if the user *already* has enough coins for the selected quiz.
-   **Mobile-First Design (Current State):** Significant overhaul to ensure full-width utilization on all mobile devices, including specific adjustments for larger phones like OnePlus 13S. This involved removing  constraints, increasing font sizes (e.g., quiz questions, options, category tabs), making buttons and touch targets much larger (e.g.,  for quiz options), and improving overall spacing and layout for a professional, easy-to-use mobile experience.
-   **WordPress News Integration:** A Latest Tech News section, fetching live articles from  (WordPress RSS feed), has been successfully integrated into the categories () page, appearing below the quiz categories.
-   **Foundational SEO:** Initial SEO elements like , , and basic metadata in  and individual pages (, , ) have been implemented.

The application's mobile design and core quiz flow are now highly optimized and directly address the user's latest feedback for better usability and a Qureka-like full-width experience.
