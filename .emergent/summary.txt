The previous AI engineer successfully migrated  to  as a Next.js application, emphasizing mobile-first design, SEO, and AdSense integration. Key achievements included replicating UI, establishing a comprehensive quiz system with original content, implementing browser-only local storage authentication, integrating WordPress news, and refining quiz flow (no login, auto-start, adjusted rewarded ads).

The current work, initiated by the new AI engineer, has focused on building a comprehensive admin dashboard. This involved creating a new backend with MongoDB for quiz management, site configuration (GA, Facebook Pixel, ad slots), script injection, rewarded popup settings, and data export. Backend authentication (JWT) and a password reset system with email integration were also developed. Frontend components for the dashboard were created, and the main application was migrated from static quiz data to fetching from the new MongoDB database. The latest interaction indicates UI/UX issues and data synchronization problems persist, requiring a thorough investigation.

The initial objective was to clone  as  using Next.js, focusing on mobile-first design, SEO, and monetization (AdSense, AdX, Prebid). This included dynamic quizzes, a coin-based reward system, and browser-only authentication using local storage. Subsequent requirements, introduced during the current development cycle, include:
1.  **Admin Dashboard:** A dedicated  route with simple username/password authentication for sole access.
2.  **Quiz Management:** Ability to add, remove, and edit quiz questions, answers, and categories through the dashboard. Quiz data must be stored in MongoDB.
3.  **Configuration Management:** Control rewarded ad popup appearance, integrate Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and add custom code to header/footer.
4.  **Ad Slot Management:** Integrate unique AdSense/Google AdX codes for each ad slot, replicating 's ad placements precisely.
5.  **Data Features:** Implement backup/export for quiz questions.
6.  **User Access:** Allow changing admin username/password within the dashboard and implement a forgot password option with email reset to .
7.  **Data Synchronization:** Ensure changes made in the admin dashboard reflect immediately on the frontend website for quiz categories and questions.
8.  **UI/UX:** Maintain a user-friendly, full-width mobile experience, addressing issues like text/element sizing across various devices.

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate actual Google AdSense, Google AdX, and Prebid (requires Publisher ID and further configuration).
-   Complete comprehensive SEO optimization for all pages and components beyond the initial setup (e.g., dynamic pages' metadata refinement).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the primary focus was on migrating the frontend quiz data to be driven by the newly implemented MongoDB backend via API calls. The admin dashboard for managing quizzes, site configurations, ad slots, and users has been largely implemented in both backend and frontend.

Key achievements in the immediate past:
-   **Backend Refinement:** Backend models (, , , , ) are defined and API endpoints for CRUD operations are implemented and tested, showing 100% success.
-   **Admin Authentication & Access:** A secure admin login system with JWT tokens, password hashing, and a password reset flow (with email integration) is functional. New admin credentials have been set (/, ).
-   **Data Migration:** Initial quiz data from the old static  was successfully migrated and populated into the MongoDB database. QuizWinz-style ad slots were also populated.
-   **Frontend Data Sync Attempt:** The frontend's categories page () and dynamic quiz page () were updated to fetch data from the new backend API endpoints instead of static files.
-   **Debugging:** The AI encountered and resolved multiple frontend build errors related to TypeScript types, environment variable usage ( vs ), and Next.js routing, particularly affecting admin pages. A direct login debug page () was created to bypass potential frontend login issues.

However, the user has reported that the UI/UX on the frontend is messed up (too big, not user-friendly) and that the data has not been synced with dashboard realtime, specifically mentioning not seeing the categories in the frontend website, in the backend dashboard. The AI's last action was to begin a Database State Investigation to thoroughly check for and fix these persisting issues, acknowledging a premature summary.
