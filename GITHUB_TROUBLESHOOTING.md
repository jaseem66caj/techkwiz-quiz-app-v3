# GitHub Repository Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Repository Not Accessible

The repository at https://github.com/jaseem66caj/TechKwiz-v8 is not accessible. This guide will help you resolve this issue.

## Possible Causes and Solutions

### 1. Repository Not Created

**Symptom**: The repository URL returns a 404 error.

**Solution**: 
- The repository may not have been created during the initial deployment.
- You need to manually create the repository on GitHub.

**Steps**:
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (jaseem66caj)
3. Fill in the form:
   - Repository name: TechKwiz-v8
   - Description: A modern interactive quiz game with visual regression testing
   - Set to Private
   - Leave all checkboxes UNCHECKED
4. Click "Create repository"
5. After creation, connect your local repository:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jaseem/Documents/GitHub/Techkwiz-v8
   git remote add origin https://github.com/jaseem66caj/TechKwiz-v8.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 2. Incorrect Repository Name

**Symptom**: The repository exists but with a different name.

**Solution**:
- Check your GitHub profile for the actual repository name.
- Update the remote URL to match the correct name.

**Steps**:
1. Visit https://github.com/jaseem66caj
2. Look for repositories that might contain "TechKwiz"
3. If found with a different name, update the remote:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jaseem66caj/ACTUAL_NAME.git
   git push origin main
   ```

### 3. Authentication Issues

**Symptom**: Permission denied errors when pushing.

**Solution**:
- Verify your Personal Access Token is still valid.
- Ensure the token has the correct permissions.

**Steps**:
1. Check if your token is still valid (valid for 90 days)
2. Verify it has "repo" permissions
3. If needed, generate a new token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token with "repo" scope
   - Update your git configuration to use the new token

### 4. Network or GitHub Service Issues

**Solution**:
- Wait and try again later
