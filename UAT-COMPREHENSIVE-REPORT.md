## 🎯 Key Achievements

### ✅ Standardized Coin Values
- **Before:** Inconsistent values (25 coins on homepage, 50 coins in categories)
- **After:** Consistent 50 coins per correct answer across all interfaces
- **Impact:** Eliminates user confusion and ensures fair reward distribution

### ✅ Centralized Configuration
- **Before:** Hardcoded values scattered throughout components
- **After:** Single source of truth in `DEFAULT_REWARD_CONFIG`
- **Impact:** Easy maintenance and consistent behavior

### ✅ Eliminated Hardcoded Values
- **Before:** Multiple files contained hardcoded coin calculations
- **After:** All calculations use centralized utility functions
- **Impact:** Prevents future inconsistencies and configuration drift

### ✅ Disabled Problematic Features
- **Ad Rewards:** Properly disabled (`enabled: false`, `rewardCoins: 0`)
- **Daily Bonus:** Properly disabled (`dailyBonus: 0`)
- **Impact:** Removes inconsistent reward sources

### ✅ Governance Implementation
- **Created:** `.augment/rules/reward-system.md`
- **Includes:** Validation checklist, change management process
- **Impact:** Prevents future violations of standardized system

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Verification

### Configuration Changes ✅
```typescript
// src/types/reward.ts - DEFAULT_REWARD_CONFIG
coinValues: {
  correct: 50,      // ✅ Increased from 25
  incorrect: 0,     // ✅ Maintained
  bonus: 50,        // ✅ Maintained (100 total with base)
  dailyBonus: 0,    // ✅ Disabled
  streakBonus: 10   // ✅ Maintained
},
adSettings: {
  enabled: false,   // ✅ Disabled
  rewardCoins: 0    // ✅ Set to 0
}
```

### Centralized Utility Functions ✅
- `src/utils/rewardCalculator.ts` created
- `calculateCorrectAnswerReward()` implemented
- `calculateQuizReward()` implemented
- `calculateBonusReward()` implemented
- All functions reference centralized configuration

### Component Updates ✅
- `src/app/providers.tsx`: Uses `calculateQuizReward()`
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Uses `calculateCorrectAnswerReward()`
- `src/app/quiz/[category]/page.tsx`: Uses centralized calculations
- `src/components/EnhancedRewardPopup.tsx`: Uses `getAdRewardAmount()`

## 🎉 User Experience Impact

### Before Implementation
- **Inconsistent Rewards:** Homepage awarded 25 coins, categories awarded 50 coins
- **User Confusion:** Different interfaces had different reward amounts
- **Maintenance Issues:** Hardcoded values scattered across multiple files
- **Configuration Drift:** No governance to prevent future inconsistencies

### After Implementation
- **Consistent Rewards:** All interfaces award 50 coins per correct answer
- **Clear User Experience:** Predictable and fair reward distribution
- **Easy Maintenance:** Single configuration source for all coin values
- **Future-Proof:** Governance rules prevent configuration drift
