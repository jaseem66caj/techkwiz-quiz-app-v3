## Next Steps

To completely remove the npm cache (optional but recommended):

1. First, ensure proper ownership:
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
```

2. Then clear the cache:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

3. If you want to completely remove the cache directory:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.npm/_cacache
```

## Ready for Development

The development environment is now clean and ready for use. You can start the development server with:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The remaining npm cache files (9 files) are minimal and won't affect development, but can be removed using the steps above if desired.
