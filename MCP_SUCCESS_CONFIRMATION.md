## 🎯 **Why You Might Think It's Not Working**

The confusion likely comes from:

1. **UI Indication**: Claude Desktop might not show "MCP Connected" in the interface
2. **Silent Operation**: MCP servers run in the background without obvious indicators
3. **Tool Discovery**: You need to ask Claude to use the tools explicitly

---

## 🧪 **Test Commands That WILL Work**

### **File System Access:**
```
"Can you list the files in my TechKwiz project directory?"
"Show me the contents of package.json"
"Find all TypeScript files in the src folder"
"Read the layout.tsx file"
```

### **Memory System:**
```
"Remember that I'm working on a quiz app called TechKwiz"
"Store this note: We fixed hydration errors on September 5th"
"What have we discussed about this project?"
```

### **GitHub Integration:**
```
"Show me the recent commits in my repository"
"Create an issue for the next feature"
"Search for React components in my GitHub repo"
```

### **Project Analysis:**
```
"Analyze the structure of my TechKwiz project"
"Help me understand the component hierarchy"
"What files are in the src/components directory?"
```
