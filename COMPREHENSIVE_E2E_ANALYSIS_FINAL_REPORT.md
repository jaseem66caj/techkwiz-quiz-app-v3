```typescript
// Check middleware configuration in middleware.ts
// Review authentication redirect logic
// Verify route guard implementations
// Test with different user states (authenticated/guest)
```

### Priority 2: HIGH - Complete Route Testing
**Once routing is fixed**:
1. Test all 7 routes individually
2. Validate null safety improvements in profile/leaderboard
3. Complete end-to-end user journey testing
4. Test multi-viewport responsive design

### Priority 3: MEDIUM - Performance Optimization
1. Monitor PM2 memory usage over extended periods
