# Reward Popup Component Consolidation

## Overview

This document describes the consolidation of three separate reward popup components into a single unified component to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

## Components Consolidated

1. `RewardPopup.tsx` - Basic reward popup with ad viewing
2. `EnhancedRewardPopup.tsx` - Advanced reward popup with animations
3. `NewRewardPopup.tsx` - Newer version with different styling

## New Unified Component

`UnifiedRewardPopup.tsx` - Single component with all features from the previous three components

## Key Features

- Animated treasure chest visualization
- Sparkle effects for visual enhancement
- Ad reward functionality (disabled per governance rules)
- Configurable props for different usage scenarios
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Full compliance with reward system governance rules

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated ~300 lines of duplicated code
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes only need to be made in one place
3. **Improved Consistency**: Guaranteed identical behavior across all usages
4. **Simplified Imports**: Only one component to import instead of three
5. **Better TypeScript Support**: Unified typing for all reward popup features

## Implementation Details

The unified component combines the best features from all three previous components:

- Treasure chest visualization from `RewardPopup.tsx`
- Sparkle animations from `EnhancedRewardPopup.tsx`
- Configurable props from `NewRewardPopup.tsx`

All coin calculations now use the centralized reward calculator utility to ensure compliance with governance rules.

## Files Modified

### New Component
- `src/components/UnifiedRewardPopup.tsx` - Single unified reward popup component

### Updated Component Imports
- `src/app/quiz/[category]/page.tsx` - Replaced `RewardPopup` with `UnifiedRewardPopup`

### Removed Components
- `src/components/RewardPopup.tsx` - Deleted (replaced by UnifiedRewardPopup)
- `src/components/EnhancedRewardPopup.tsx` - Deleted (replaced by UnifiedRewardPopup)
- `src/components/NewRewardPopup.tsx` - Deleted (replaced by UnifiedRewardPopup)

## Testing

The unified reward popup has been tested in the following scenarios:

1. Correct answer reward display
2. Incorrect answer reward display
3. Ad reward functionality (disabled per governance)
4. User interaction with claim/skip buttons
5. Visual effects and animations
6. Responsive design across different screen sizes

## Governance Compliance

The implementation fully complies with the reward system governance rules:

- All coin calculations reference `DEFAULT_REWARD_CONFIG`
- No hardcoded coin values are used
- Ad rewards are disabled as required
- Centralized reward calculation utility is used

## Risk Mitigation

- **Backward Compatibility**: ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- **Error Handling**: ✅ All existing error handling preserved
- **Testing Coverage**: ✅ All reward popup modes and edge cases tested
- **UI/UX Consistency**: ✅ Pixel-perfect consistency maintained
